Implementation of Naïve Bayesian Classifier Algorithm

Code implements naïve bayesian classifier learning algorithm given a training file and reports accuracy of classification given a testing file using both the MLE (maximum likelihood estimation) approach and the MAP (Maximum a Posteriori - Laplace estimation) approach.

File requirements: All input features are always binary variables (0 or 1) and the output class is also always a binary variable (0 or 1).
